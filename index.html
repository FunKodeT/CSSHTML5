            <p><strong>Welcome to my homepage!</strong> I am <u>FunKooT</u>, <u>FunKodeT</u>, or <u>Matthew Cootey</u> depending on your relation to me. 
                <br>I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah; The schools I attended were Redwood Elementary, Crestview Elementary, Evergreen Jr. High, Olympus Jr. High, and Olympus High. My first job was as a 'Courtesy Clerk' at a local grocery store before I joined the U.S. Army where I served for 8 years. 
                <br><img src="Resources/Us.png" alt="sabrina and me"><br>
                As of 2018, I am married to my beautiful and lovely spouse Sabrina. We own two beautiful dogs in our house in Stansbury Park. 
                <br><img src="Resources/Gir.png" alt="gir"><br>
                Gir is our first dog, a black lab, and we got him in Hawaii. He loves the sun, sleeping, and loves love. 
                <br><img src="Resources/Maze.png" alt="Maze">
                Maze is our second dog, an Anatolian Shepherd, and we got her in Utah. She loves being outside, treats, and if she could speak she would say she hates love (Which is a lie). 
                <br>In 2021, I was medically discharged for injuries and issues accrued through service. Upon discharge, I returned to Salt Lake City to pursue an education with the focus of Video Game Design in mind.</p>
